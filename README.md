### Responsiveness

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 320px and upwards as defined in [WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari browsers.

Steps to test:

1. Open browser and navigate to [ZTTLPrint](https://gkopanidis.github.io/LawnMowerPlates/)
2. Open the developer tools (right click and inspect)
3. Set to responsive and decrease width to 320px
4. Set the zoom to 50%
5. Click and drag the responsive window to maximum width

Expected:

Website is responsive on all screen sizes and no images are pixelated or stretched.
No horizontal scroll is present.
No elements overlap.


<!-- TOC --><a name="accessibility"></a>

### Accessibility
[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used throughout development and for final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing.

Testing was focused to ensure the following criteria were met:

- All forms have associated labels or aria-labels so that this is read out on a screen reader to users who tab to form inputs
- Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in [WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
- Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user
- All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions
- All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers
- HTML page lang attribute has been set
- Aria properties have been implemented correctly
- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed

## Deployment


<!-- TOC --><a name="version-control"></a>

### Version Control

The site was created using the Visual Studio code editor and pushed to github to the remote repository ‘tacos-travels’.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

```git add <file>``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

```git commit -m “commit message”``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.


<!-- TOC --><a name="deployment-github"></a>

### Deployment to Github Pages

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
   - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
   - From the source section drop-down menu, select the master branch
   - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
